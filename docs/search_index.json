How to provide feedback If you have any suggestions, questions or comments while reading through this guide or want to provide any other feedback on how to improve this guide, we are happy to receive your feedback through the Github repository where you can add your remarks as a new issue! Disclaimer We want to emphasise here that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and every dataset will bring its own challenges that need individual solutions. We cannot tackle all of these challenges but only give recommendations based on our own work with a range of different ecological datasets. The FAIR principles are not set in stone but rather intended as guidance. Practical implications should be interpreted by each community individually, while sticking as closely as possible to the principles themselves (cf. Maturity Indicator Authoring Group). We therefore also want to stress that the way we implement FAIR in this guide is only one way of operationalising it and is based on our own interpretations and extensions of the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. (2016)).

Throughout the whole lifecycle, good data management is crucial to ultimately enhance the reusability of the data for yourself and others. For example, by storing your data persistently and implementing versioning, you lower the risk of data loss and have higher traceability of changes and errors. Additionally, by describing, annotating, and organising the data, it becomes better understandable for others, facilitating its reuse and increasing its impact and that of the associated research. One way of reaching the goals of good data management is to make your data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). For this, FAIR guiding principles have been developed that provide people with a set of considerations to evaluate whether data can be discovered and reused by others. See this chapter for more info on FAIR. How to read this guide This guide is designed in a way that you can only read the chapters that are relevant for enriching your data. To find these chapters, we provide you with a self-evaluation tool that shows to what extent your data already complies with the FAIR principles. Directly based on the outcome of the FAIR and structure evaluation you will be provided with a tailored list of the chapters in this guide you could go through to further enrich your data. You therefore do not have to read the full guide from top to bottom but should easily be able to only go through the chapters most relevant to you. How this guide came to be The project “Data for Digital Twins - Piloting a FAIR Data Infrastructure for the Advanced Modelling of Ecological Data”, or FAIR Data for Digital Twins for short, was a collaborative project in 2023-2024 between the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) and the Dutch Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW) funded by the research fund of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). The project aimed to explore how to make quantitative ecological data more FAIR and fit for advanced analytical and modelling purposes, such as artificial intelligence and digital twins. One of the main goals of this project was to use hands-on experience from FAIRifying a range of different ecological datasets to create a manual that guides ecologists step-by-step through the process of FAIRifying their ecological data themselves. Many ecological datasets are not compliant with the FAIR data principles, which makes it difficult to share and exchange biological data. This is also true for the data collected at NIOO and together with the general movement towards open and FAIR data, this initialised this project. "],["01.1-FAIR-assessment.html", "0.1 FAIR and structure evaluation of your data", " 0.1 FAIR and structure evaluation of your data Datasets vary widely in format and complexity, as well as degree of structure and FAIRness. It is therefore important to first evaluate which state your data is in and what steps you can take to further enrich of your data. Even though there is already a range of FAIR assessment tools available (see here for an overview), that can either automatically assess the FAIRness of your data or provide self-assessment questionnaires, we decided to develop our own tool for several reasons: Existing tools tend to purely assign a score to the data but provide little guidance on how to actually improve the FAIRness of the data (Krans et al. (2022)). In contrast, our tool directly provides suggestions on how to enrich the data based on the given answers and by directing the user to the corresponding chapters of this guide. We do not score the data for every letter of FAIR as done in other tools, but score them in the four properties metadata, storage, standards and structure (more details below). While the evaluation questions of the first three components are directly derived from the FAIR principles, the structure component is an extension of FAIR not included in other tools. Automated tools often require the data to be available online already, which is not the state at which we want to start with our evaluation. Our evaluation tool “FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool” (FAIR+SET) provides you with a set of simple questions about four properties of your data: metadata, storage, standards and structure. FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool (FAIR+SET) The FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool is still in development, but a preliminary version can be accessed through https://lter-life-experience.org/fairset/. Every question in the tool comes with a small info box (when clicking on the question mark) and can be answered with yes or no. Once you submit your answers, you will be provided with the evaluation outcome and the links to the respective sections in the guide useful to further enhance your data. A complete list of the questions and their info boxes can also be found in the end of this guide in the section Questions for FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool. Metadata is data about your data and contains information about the who, where, what, when and how of data collection allowing another user of your data to understand and reuse it without prior knowledge of the data. Storage is about whether your data is stored persistently and in a way that makes it findable and accessible to others. Standards describe uniform, community-accepted formats in which both data and metadata are stored and which enhance compatibility with other datasets. Structure is about whether your data is organised in a consistent and logical way that makes the data easier to understand for others. Apart from the questions about structure, the questions in the evaluation are all directly based on the FAIR principles. Figure 0.1 visualises how the data properties in the evaluation link to the letters of FAIR. Your answers will provide you with a circle diagram showing the status of your dataset in each of the properties and an associated list of chapters of this manual you can work through to further enrich your data. Figure 0.1: Link between data properties and FAIR. The letters on the left stand for the data properties used in the FAIR and structure evaluation (metadata, storage, standard, structure). Each plus indicates that the data property improves the maturity of each of the respective letter of FAIR. A blank space means that this data property has no direct influence on the respective letter of FAIR. It will likely be difficult to reach the full score in all of the properties of your data, but this is also not necessarily the aim of this evaluation or guide. Every improvement is already a great step! Especially the components that link to interoperability are more difficult to implement, as true interoperability generally is a big challenge within and across disciplines (Pagano et al. (2013)). One step to reach interoperability is to use a language for knowledge representation and linked data, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework). However, as this is more the expertise of data scientists or information scientists instead of ecologists, we will not look into these topics in this guide and, hence, it is not possible to reach the full score in the evaluation of “Standards” by only following this guide. For more information on full interoperability see this section. References Krans, N. A., Ammar, A., Nymark, P., Willighagen, E. L., Bakker, M. I., &amp; Quik, J. T. K. (2022).

As shown in Figure 0.2, each FAIR principle translates to one or more questions. Principles that are applicable to both data and metadata are split into separate questions. Figure 0.2: Each of the FAIR principles (grey boxes) can directly be linked to one or more of the questions of our evaluation tool (coloured boxes, pink for metadata, blue for storage, green for standards). The questions about structure are missing, as they are not directly derived from the FAIR principles. "],["02-example-datasets.html", " 1 Example datasets 1.1 Bud burst data 1.2 Cricket data 1.3 CLUE field vegetation cover data (i.e., CLUE data)", " 1 Example datasets To illustrate the process of FAIRifying and structuring ecological data, we rely on several example datasets we used to develop this guide. These datasets were selected because they cover a broad variety of different structures and different levels of FAIR, ranging from observational to experimental data and from highly unstructured and undocumented data to data that already fulfils some of the FAIR principles. For all example datasets we went through the full workflow described in this guide, except the step of publishing the standardized and structured version of the data on a repository. This is still work in progress, as we rely on datasets of others whose permission is needed for that. Without storing the data on a repository, many of the circles in the evaluation cannot be filled. In the following figures we therefore use solid circles for already fulfilled evaluation criteria and striped circles for criteria that will be fulfilled once the dataset is stored in a suitable repository. 1.1 Bud burst data This dataset contains long-term data on the phenology of different tree species. Every year in spring, deciduous trees develop new leaves from their buds at a certain point in time. The timing of this can be crucial for herbivores, such as caterpillars, relying on newly emerging leaves as an important food source. To monitor shifts in tree phenology, the Department of Animal Ecology at NIOO-KNAW has assessed leaf development every year since 1988 by scoring the stage of bud opening on a fixed scale (cf. Visser &amp; Holleman (2001)). The data is stored on DataverseNL. Figure 1.1: FAIR assessment of bud burst data. Striped circles indicate the hypothetical status of the dataset once it is stored in a repository (see note box above). 1.2 Cricket data This dataset contains experimental data on invertebrates belonging to the publication of Vogels et al. (2021). They tested whether changes in plant N:P ratios following sod-cutting constrain the reproductive potential in the European field cricket (Gryllus campestris). Different phosphorus and liming treatments were applied to vegetation plots in the heathlands of the Veluwe and the plants of these plots used in a feeding experiment in which the reproductive success of the female crickets was measured. The data is stored on the DANS Data Station. Figure 1.2: FAIR assessment of cricket data. Striped circles indicate the hypothetical status of the dataset once it is stored in a repository (see note box above). 1.3 CLUE field vegetation cover data (i.e., CLUE data) This dataset consists of data on vegetation cover collected in a long-term grassland biodiversity field experiment site in the Veluwe, Netherlands, also abbreviated as CLUE fields (= changing land usage, enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystem development). Data collection started in 1996 and was done by the Department of Terrestrial Ecology of NIOO-KNAW. On a former agricultural field, experimental plots have been established in a random block design and different sowing treatments (i.e., high diversity, low diversity, continued agricultural rotation, and natural succession), as well as soil inoculation treatments have been applied in two different experiments in 1996. In both experiments, percent cover of each occurring plant species is measured annually. The data of both experiments resulted in two independent datasets. They are however very similar and their FAIRification process was nearly the same, so we treat them as one in this guide. Figure 1.3: FAIR assessment of CLUE data. Striped circles indicate the hypothetical status of the dataset once it is stored in a repository (see note box above). References Visser, M. E., &amp; Holleman, L. J. M. (2001).

To make your data more FAIR and structured, we recommend you to take the following steps: Describe your data and thereby gather metadata You should decide whether your raw data should be mobilised to an online repository If yes, you have to choose a suitable repository and upload your metadata and data there Start to standardise both the data and the metadata. With which of the two you start does not matter, as they can both be structured and standardised separately For the metadata: Choose a metadata standard Map the metadata to the selected standard For the data: Choose a suitable data standard Map the data to that standard For further standardisation of your data, use ontologies and biological taxonomies where possible to describe the contents of the data Choose a standardised structure for the data Restructure your data according to the chosen structure Once standards and structure are applied, structural metadata can be created that describes how the data is organised in its new form As a last step, your standardised data and metadata should be persistently stored in an online storage If you have not chosen a repository before (or if you want to store the standardised data elsewhere), you should: Choose a suitable repository that accepts your new data structure/format Mobilise the data and the metadata to the chosen repository You can enter this workflow at any point, depending on the status of your data, and it might be necessary to go back and forth between some of the steps. Even though this guide is tailored to ecological data, the workflow presented here should be generally applicable to any type of data, only the implementations of each step will differ. In the following chapters, we will go through each of the steps and provide some general background, introduce some options for implementation for ecological data and considerations that can help to choose the best suited option for your data, as well as a short insight into our own choices for the example datasets. Figure 2.1: Diagram of the workflow presented in this guide to FAIRify data. "],["04-Describe-data.html", " 3 Primary data 3.1 Describe your data (Metadata)", " 3 Primary data 3.1 Describe your data (Metadata) Independent of whether you aim to publish your data, it is always important to properly describe and annotate the data. This type of description is called metadata and provides information about your dataset that helps to find, understand, and reuse it. We can distinguish between administrative, descriptive and structural metadata: Administrative metadata includes information about the authors, usage (i.e., licence), and maintenance of the data Descriptive metadata includes information about the contents, provenance (i.e., the source and/or history), and coverage (e.g., time, geographic location) of the data Structural metadata provides details about how the dataset is organised and how individual data files are related to each other Many repositories require a minimal set of metadata when uploading data, which can either directly be entered in a fill-in form provided by the repository or added in a separate file that is uploaded together with the data. The simplest form of metadata is a README text file containing some basic information on what the data is about. There are, however, no regulations on what information a README should contain and in practice, the extent and detail of it varies a lot. In general, the richer the data is described the better. Be aware There is another section on standardising your metadata that builds on the current section as it assumes that metadata has already been gathered. If you want to both gather and standardise metadata, you can do both steps at once and directly write the metadata in the standard format instead of creating a README first. Based on best practices of writing README files and in terms of standardising the metadata in a later step, we recommend to gather the following information about your data: Recommended best practises for minimum metadata: Title of the dataset Short description of the contents of each data file Short description of the methods used for data collection Responsible parties, including those who created the data and those who can be contacted to answer questions about the data When was the data collected? Which time span is covered? Where has the data been collected? Licencing information: How can others use your data? To find out more about different licences, see section Licencing Changes in the data or updates should ideally also be recorded in the README Do different tables within a file and/or different files in the dataset link to each other? If yes, a short description of how they link (e.g., by which identifier) Describe the context of the dataset by cross-referencing other relevant and related datasets or metadata. These links should be meaningful by qualifying how different resources link to each other (e.g., dataset A is a derivative of dataset B or B contains complementary information to A). A template that covers these minimum metadata fields can be found here: README template. Or follow this example of the bud burst data. For tabular data: In addition to providing metadata at the dataset level, as listed above, it is recommended for tabular data to provide a data dictionary (sometimes called a codebook). A data dictionary provides the meaning of the columns and values in your data files. It serves as a reference guide for people who want to reuse your data, as it improves the interpretation and understanding of the data. For data stored in a relational database, the data dictionary is an active document, meaning that it is updated whenever the tables and columns in the database change. In most other cases, data dictionaries are static documents that need to be created manually. When you do so, describe: The meaning or definition of columns The data type (e.g., integer, string, datetime) The unit in which the measurement is given The accepted values for a column, including the meaning of codes (e.g., 0 = absent, 1 = present) (optional) If you include personal information, like email addresses, of other people in the metadata that is made available online later on, it should always be asked for permission beforehand. 3.1.1 Licencing If you deposit your data online, it is important to communicate to potential users what permissions they have and arrange a legal agreement in the form of a licence. A commonly used set of licences are the copyright licences of Creative Commons (CC). Scientific datasets most often are published under a CC BY licence, but Creative Commons also offers other licensing options, as stated in Table 4.1. They also offer an interactive tool (License chooser) that can help you to choose the best suited licence for your data. Table 4.1. Creative commons licences and their meanings. Licence What can users do with your data? CC BY users can use, distribute and build upon the data but have to give credits to the creator CC BY-NC users can use, distribute and build upon the data but have to give credits to the creator and data cannot be used commercially CC BY-SA users can use, distribute and build upon the data, they have to give credits to the creator and adaptations need to be shared under the same terms CC BY-NC-SA users can use, distribute and build upon the data, they have to give credits to the creator, adaptations need to be shared under the same terms and data cannot be used commercially CC BY-ND users are not allowed to adapt or modify the data, but can copy or distribute it if they give credits to the creator CC BY-NC-ND users are not allowed to adapt or modify the data, but can copy or distribute it if they give credits to the creator and data cannot be used commercially CC0 (“CC Zero”) copyrights are given up and work is put into the public domain Carefully consider which licence to choose. It cannot be revoked and every user of the data needs to comply with the licence’s conditions of use, even if the data is no longer distributed. "],["04.1-Structure-tabular-data.html", "3.2 Structuring your tabular data", " 3.2 Structuring your tabular data A common way of storing biodiversity data is in tables. However, simply entering the data into a spreadsheet does often not adhere to the strict requirements of tabular data, which has the following characteristics: Structured in rows and columns A row contains information about a single entity (e.g., a person’s name, age, or occupation), whilst a single column describes the same property of each entity (e.g., the names of all persons) Rectangular shape, in which each row has the same number of columns and each column the same number of rows Cells in a row/column can be left empty For a more extensive and formal description of tabular data, see W3C’s tabular data model. To standardise the data and make it reusable to others and to follow the remaining steps of this guide, it is a necessary prerequisite that data that is meant to be tabular follows the aforementioned characteristics. If not, reshape your data accordingly. If your data consists of multiple tables, the relationships between these tables should be made clear. This can be done either by describing it in a README file (see section 4.1) or, if your data is already in a standard format, in a more standardised way, such as the meta.xml file described here.
