How to provide feedback If you have any suggestions, questions or comments while reading through this guide or want to provide any other feedback on how to improve this guide, we are happy to receive your feedback through the Github repository where you can add your remarks as a new issue! Disclaimer We want to emphasise here that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and every dataset will bring its own challenges that need individual solutions. We cannot tackle all of these challenges but only give recommendations based on our own work with a range of different ecological datasets. The FAIR principles are not set in stone but rather intended as guidance. Practical implications should be interpreted by each community individually, while sticking as closely as possible to the principles themselves (cf. Maturity Indicator Authoring Group). We therefore also want to stress that the way we implement FAIR in this guide is only one way of operationalising it and is based on our own interpretations and extensions of the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. (2016)).

Throughout the whole lifecycle, good data management is crucial to ultimately enhance the reusability of the data for yourself and others. For example, by storing your data persistently and implementing versioning, you lower the risk of data loss and have higher traceability of changes and errors. Additionally, by describing, annotating, and organising the data, it becomes better understandable for others, facilitating its reuse and increasing its impact and that of the associated research. One way of reaching the goals of good data management is to make your data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). For this, FAIR guiding principles have been developed that provide people with a set of considerations to evaluate whether data can be discovered and reused by others. See this chapter for more info on FAIR. How to read this guide This guide is designed in a way that you can only read the chapters that are relevant for enriching your data. To find these chapters, we provide you with a self-evaluation tool that shows to what extent your data already complies with the FAIR principles. Directly based on the outcome of the FAIR and structure evaluation you will be provided with a tailored list of the chapters in this guide you could go through to further enrich your data. You therefore do not have to read the full guide from top to bottom but should easily be able to only go through the chapters most relevant to you. How this guide came to be The project “Data for Digital Twins - Piloting a FAIR Data Infrastructure for the Advanced Modelling of Ecological Data”, or FAIR Data for Digital Twins for short, was a collaborative project in 2023-2024 between the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) and the Dutch Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW) funded by the research fund of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). The project aimed to explore how to make quantitative ecological data more FAIR and fit for advanced analytical and modelling purposes, such as artificial intelligence and digital twins. One of the main goals of this project was to use hands-on experience from FAIRifying a range of different ecological datasets to create a manual that guides ecologists step-by-step through the process of FAIRifying their ecological data themselves. Many ecological datasets are not compliant with the FAIR data principles, which makes it difficult to share and exchange biological data. This is also true for the data collected at NIOO and together with the general movement towards open and FAIR data, this initialised this project. "],["01-introduction.html", " 1 Introduction 1.1 What is FAIR? 1.2 Adding structure to FAIR 1.3 FAIR is not open 1.4 Why should you make your data more FAIR?", " 1 Introduction 1.1 What is FAIR? Research data often is stored on local hard drives, not well described or not formatted in a consistent and standard way. This makes it very difficult for others (and often even for the data owner themselves) to reuse the data or reproduce the research, because the data is not straightforward to understand, cannot be interpreted correctly, or, in case of local storage, might be unknown to others. In order to change this and increase the reusability of data, Wilkinson et al. (2016) introduced the FAIR concept together with 15 guiding principles providing guidance on how to implement it. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, which more concrete means the following: Findable means that the metadata and the data can be easily found by both humans and computers, and that machine-actionable metadata allows for discovery of the data by machines. When you present data in a relevant repository and make sure that they are described with thorough and relevant metadata, you make it possible for others to find them. Accessible means that there is information on how humans or computers gain access to the data. This does not mean that the data have to be openly available for everyone (see FAIR is not open), but that the freely available metadata clearly indicates to both humans and computers how and under what conditions data can be retrieved. Interoperable means that (meta)data can be integrated with other (meta)data, and that (meta)data can be exchanged and used across different systems. In other words, data resources should ‘speak the same language’ to be used together. Reusable means that data are sufficiently annotated and curated so that others – humans and machines – can understand the context and methods of data collection, correctly interpret the meaning of the data, and accurately reuse the data. Figure 1.1: The FAIR concept. The four letters of FAIR stand for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable and come with 15 guiding principles. The 15 guiding principles describe different elements or characteristics of datasets that can be adhered to in different combinations – partly through the distinction between data and metadata – and to different maturity levels (see also FAIR Data Maturity Model. Specification and Guidelines of RDA). As a result, datasets can vary widely in their FAIRness level and datasets that have the same overall level of FAIRness may differ in the components of FAIR they adhere to. For an entertaining but serious description of the FAIR principles and their meaning, we recommend reading “A FAIRy tale - A fake story in a trustworthy guide to the FAIR principles for research data” created within the Danish ‘FAIR across’ (FAIR på tværs) project: https://forskningsdata.dk/fairytale/ (Hansen et al. (2018)). 1.2 Adding structure to FAIR In this guide we extend FAIR as it is defined by the FAIR principles in order to make it workable in practice. This means that we include the component of structuring your data into the FAIRification process. Structuring your data, i.e., organising it in a tidy way, can make the data easier to access for others and enhances its understandability. We therefore think that this is a crucial component of increasing the reusability of your data. 1.3 FAIR is not open It is important to emphasise that FAIR is not equal to open. While the metadata of your data should be openly available to enable the discovery of your data by others, the data itself does not have to be open. If you have reasons for not making the data openly available to everyone (e.g., because it contains sensitive information), this can and should be made clear in the metadata where according licensing information and access rights can be provided. As long as this is guaranteed, restricted or closed data can also be completely FAIR. 1.4 Why should you make your data more FAIR? Depending on the current status of your data, making data FAIR certainly requires some effort, but the benefits are evident both for yourself and for others. Findable and well-annotated data facilitates your own reuse of your data in the future and the reuse of your data by others, which simultaneously increases the visibility and the impact of your research. Increasing the interoperability of your data additionally increases the possibilities for collaborations, as your data can be integrated with other data, and hence will benefit the scientific community as a whole.

It is therefore important to first evaluate which state your data is in and what steps you can take to further enrich of your data. Even though there is already a range of FAIR assessment tools available (see here for an overview), that can either automatically assess the FAIRness of your data or provide self-assessment questionnaires, we decided to develop our own tool for several reasons: Existing tools tend to purely assign a score to the data but provide little guidance on how to actually improve the FAIRness of the data (Krans et al. (2022)). In contrast, our tool directly provides suggestions on how to enrich the data based on the given answers and by directing the user to the corresponding chapters of this guide. We do not score the data for every letter of FAIR as done in other tools, but score them in the four properties metadata, storage, standards and structure (more details below). While the evaluation questions of the first three components are directly derived from the FAIR principles, the structure component is an extension of FAIR not included in other tools. Automated tools often require the data to be available online already, which is not the state at which we want to start with our evaluation. Our evaluation tool “FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool” (FAIR+SET) provides you with a set of simple questions about four properties of your data: metadata, storage, standards and structure. FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool (FAIR+SET) The FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool is still in development, but a preliminary version can be accessed through https://lter-life-experience.org/fairset/. Every question in the tool comes with a small info box (when clicking on the question mark) and can be answered with yes or no. Once you submit your answers, you will be provided with the evaluation outcome and the links to the respective sections in the guide useful to further enhance your data. A complete list of the questions and their info boxes can also be found in the end of this guide in the section Questions for FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool. Metadata is data about your data and contains information about the who, where, what, when and how of data collection allowing another user of your data to understand and reuse it without prior knowledge of the data. Storage is about whether your data is stored persistently and in a way that makes it findable and accessible to others. Standards describe uniform, community-accepted formats in which both data and metadata are stored and which enhance compatibility with other datasets. Structure is about whether your data is organised in a consistent and logical way that makes the data easier to understand for others. Apart from the questions about structure, the questions in the evaluation are all directly based on the FAIR principles. Figure 1.2 visualises how the data properties in the evaluation link to the letters of FAIR. Your answers will provide you with a circle diagram showing the status of your dataset in each of the properties and an associated list of chapters of this manual you can work through to further enrich your data. Figure 1.2: Link between data properties and FAIR. The letters on the left stand for the data properties used in the FAIR and structure evaluation (metadata, storage, standard, structure). Each plus indicates that the data property improves the maturity of each of the respective letter of FAIR. A blank space means that this data property has no direct influence on the respective letter of FAIR. It will likely be difficult to reach the full score in all of the properties of your data, but this is also not necessarily the aim of this evaluation or guide. Every improvement is already a great step! Especially the components that link to interoperability are more difficult to implement, as true interoperability generally is a big challenge within and across disciplines (Pagano et al. (2013)). One step to reach interoperability is to use a language for knowledge representation and linked data, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework). However, as this is more the expertise of data scientists or information scientists instead of ecologists, we will not look into these topics in this guide and, hence, it is not possible to reach the full score in the evaluation of “Standards” by only following this guide.

As shown in Figure 1.3, each FAIR principle translates to one or more questions. Principles that are applicable to both data and metadata are split into separate questions. Figure 1.3: Each of the FAIR principles (grey boxes) can directly be linked to one or more of the questions of our evaluation tool (coloured boxes, pink for metadata, blue for storage, green for standards). The questions about structure are missing, as they are not directly derived from the FAIR principles.
