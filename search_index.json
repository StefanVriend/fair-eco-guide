How to provide feedback If you have any suggestions, questions or comments while reading through this guide or want to provide any other feedback on how to improve this guide, we are happy to receive your feedback through the Github repository where you can add your remarks as a new issue! Disclaimer We want to emphasise here that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and every dataset will bring its own challenges that need individual solutions. We cannot tackle all of these challenges but only give recommendations based on our own work with a range of different ecological datasets. The FAIR principles are not set in stone but rather intended as guidance. Practical implications should be interpreted by each community individually, while sticking as closely as possible to the principles themselves (cf. Maturity Indicator Authoring Group). We therefore also want to stress that the way we implement FAIR in this guide is only one way of operationalising it and is based on our own interpretations and extensions of the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. (2016)).

Throughout the whole lifecycle, good data management is crucial to ultimately enhance the reusability of the data for yourself and others. For example, by storing your data persistently and implementing versioning, you lower the risk of data loss and have higher traceability of changes and errors. Additionally, by describing, annotating, and organising the data, it becomes better understandable for others, facilitating its reuse and increasing its impact and that of the associated research. One way of reaching the goals of good data management is to make your data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). For this, FAIR guiding principles have been developed that provide people with a set of considerations to evaluate whether data can be discovered and reused by others. See this chapter for more info on FAIR. How to read this guide This guide is designed in a way that you can only read the chapters that are relevant for enriching your data. To find these chapters, we provide you with a self-evaluation tool that shows to what extent your data already complies with the FAIR principles. Directly based on the outcome of the FAIR and structure evaluation you will be provided with a tailored list of the chapters in this guide you could go through to further enrich your data. You therefore do not have to read the full guide from top to bottom but should easily be able to only go through the chapters most relevant to you. How this guide came to be The project “Data for Digital Twins - Piloting a FAIR Data Infrastructure for the Advanced Modelling of Ecological Data”, or FAIR Data for Digital Twins for short, was a collaborative project in 2023-2024 between the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) and the Dutch Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW) funded by the research fund of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). The project aimed to explore how to make quantitative ecological data more FAIR and fit for advanced analytical and modelling purposes, such as artificial intelligence and digital twins. One of the main goals of this project was to use hands-on experience from FAIRifying a range of different ecological datasets to create a manual that guides ecologists step-by-step through the process of FAIRifying their ecological data themselves. Many ecological datasets are not compliant with the FAIR data principles, which makes it difficult to share and exchange biological data. This is also true for the data collected at NIOO and together with the general movement towards open and FAIR data, this initialised this project. "],["01.1-FAIR-assessment.html", "0.1 FAIR and structure evaluation of your data", " 0.1 FAIR and structure evaluation of your data Datasets vary widely in format and complexity, as well as degree of structure and FAIRness. It is therefore important to first evaluate which state your data is in and what steps you can take to further enrich of your data. Even though there is already a range of FAIR assessment tools available (see here for an overview), that can either automatically assess the FAIRness of your data or provide self-assessment questionnaires, we decided to develop our own tool for several reasons: Existing tools tend to purely assign a score to the data but provide little guidance on how to actually improve the FAIRness of the data (Krans et al. (2022)). In contrast, our tool directly provides suggestions on how to enrich the data based on the given answers and by directing the user to the corresponding chapters of this guide. We do not score the data for every letter of FAIR as done in other tools, but score them in the four properties metadata, storage, standards and structure (more details below). While the evaluation questions of the first three components are directly derived from the FAIR principles, the structure component is an extension of FAIR not included in other tools. Automated tools often require the data to be available online already, which is not the state at which we want to start with our evaluation. Our evaluation tool “FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool” (FAIR+SET) provides you with a set of simple questions about four properties of your data: metadata, storage, standards and structure. FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool (FAIR+SET) The FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool is still in development, but a preliminary version can be accessed through https://lter-life-experience.org/fairset/. Every question in the tool comes with a small info box (when clicking on the question mark) and can be answered with yes or no. Once you submit your answers, you will be provided with the evaluation outcome and the links to the respective sections in the guide useful to further enhance your data. A complete list of the questions and their info boxes can also be found in the end of this guide in the section Questions for FAIR + Structure Evaluation Tool. Metadata is data about your data and contains information about the who, where, what, when and how of data collection allowing another user of your data to understand and reuse it without prior knowledge of the data. Storage is about whether your data is stored persistently and in a way that makes it findable and accessible to others. Standards describe uniform, community-accepted formats in which both data and metadata are stored and which enhance compatibility with other datasets. Structure is about whether your data is organised in a consistent and logical way that makes the data easier to understand for others. Apart from the questions about structure, the questions in the evaluation are all directly based on the FAIR principles. Figure 1 visualises how the data properties in the evaluation link to the letters of FAIR. Your answers will provide you with a circle diagram showing the status of your dataset in each of the properties and an associated list of chapters of this manual you can work through to further enrich your data. Figure 1: Link between data properties and FAIR. The letters on the left stand for the data properties used in the FAIR and structure evaluation (metadata, storage, standard, structure). Each plus indicates that the data property improves the maturity of each of the respective letter of FAIR. A blank space means that this data property has no direct influence on the respective letter of FAIR. It will likely be difficult to reach the full score in all of the properties of your data, but this is also not necessarily the aim of this evaluation or guide. Every improvement is already a great step! Especially the components that link to interoperability are more difficult to implement, as true interoperability generally is a big challenge within and across disciplines (Pagano et al. (2013)). One step to reach interoperability is to use a language for knowledge representation and linked data, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework). However, as this is more the expertise of data scientists or information scientists instead of ecologists, we will not look into these topics in this guide and, hence, it is not possible to reach the full score in the evaluation of “Standards” by only following this guide. For more information on full interoperability see this section. References Krans, N. A., Ammar, A., Nymark, P., Willighagen, E. L., Bakker, M. I., &amp; Quik, J. T. K. (2022).

As shown in Figure 2, each FAIR principle translates to one or more questions. Principles that are applicable to both data and metadata are split into separate questions. Figure 2: Each of the FAIR principles (grey boxes) can directly be linked to one or more of the questions of our evaluation tool (coloured boxes, pink for metadata, blue for storage, green for standards).
